【Introduction】

This folder contains a collection of portfolio projects developed to demonstrate my frontend engineering skills. Focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created these projects while learning key concepts such as DOM manipulation, asynchronous processing, and API integration. Each project reflects my progress as a self-taught developer transitioning into the tech industry.

【Concept】

As someone aiming to change careers and become a frontend engineer with no prior experience, I created these projects with the intention of showcasing practical skills in a way that's easy to understand at a glance. My focus was on:

- Simple and intuitive UI/UX design  
- Applying core frontend technologies effectively  
- Building scalable projects that can be further developed  

【Overview】

This directory includes the following individual projects:

- `todo-app`: A simple ToDo list app where users can add, complete, and delete tasks  
- `job-tracker`: A basic job application tracker for managing and reviewing applications  
- `weather-app`: A weather app that fetches data from an external API to show real-time weather information  
- `movie-search`: A movie search app built using the OMDB API  

Each folder includes a README with more detailed information.

【Environment】

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6)  
- Libraries: None (some projects use external APIs)  
- Development environment: Visual Studio Code  
- Version control: Git / GitHub  
- Tested on: Google Chrome  

【How to Run】
These are static projects and do not require any special build tools or package managers. You can run them locally using your browser:

bash

・ Navigate to a project directory
cd todo-app

・ Open the file in your browser
・ Example: For Mac with Google Chrome
open -a "Google Chrome" 

【Planned Features】
I plan to continue developing and improving these projects by adding the following features:

Add search and filtering functions to the Job Tracker

Add geolocation and weather history features to the Weather App

Add a "Favorites" feature and detail pages to the Movie App

Rebuild the entire portfolio using frameworks like React to improve maintainability and reusability

【Conclusion】
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey and growth as an aspiring engineer. While there is still much to improve in terms of code quality, design, and usability, each project showcases my dedication and passion for learning. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
